# OpenRide

> Open-source ride-booking & dispatch platform for regional operators, driver cooperatives, EV fleets, booked-hire services, and community transport.

## Why this exists

Commercial ride-hailing platforms are not built for small operators, cooperatives, or community transport. They charge per-trip commissions, lock you into their terms, and don't model compliance the way regulators expect. OpenRide is a self-hostable alternative that respects transport compliance from day 1 (driver authorities, vehicle inspections, CTP, fatigue, incident logging) and gives operators control of their fleet, fares, and data.

This is the MVP scaffold. See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the system design and the plan file at `/Users/adam/.claude/plans/you-are-acting-as-starry-starfish.md` for full scope.

## Status

**MVP feature-complete (single-operator).** End-to-end loop works: rider signup → book → automatic dispatch → driver accept & drive → complete → payment → receipt, with an operator console, compliance + fatigue enforcement, and incident reporting. Payments verify against Stripe test keys; multi-operator (Phase 9) is the next milestone. See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) and [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Quick start (local dev)

Prereqs: Node 22, pnpm 9, Docker, the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli), and (for mobile) the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/ibrahimkasende-crypto/taxi-na-biso.git
cd taxi-na-biso

# Install
     pnpm install

# Copy env template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start local Supabase (Postgres + PostGIS + Auth + Storage + Realtime)
make up

# Apply migrations + seed demo data
make reset

# Generate typed DB client
make types

# Run all apps in parallel
pnpm dev
```

Then:

- Site public / Client / Chauffeur : http://localhost:3001
- Admin portal: http://localhost:3000
- Rider app: scan QR from `apps/rider` (Expo Go) or open `i`/`a`
- Driver app: scan QR from `apps/driver`

Demo accounts (after `make reset`, **local / staging only**):

- Client: `taxinabiso@client.com` / `123456` → http://localhost:3001/connexion
- Chauffeur: `taxinabiso@chauffeur.com` / `123456` → http://localhost:3001/chauffeur/connexion
- Admin: `admin@taxinabiso.com` / `123456` → http://localhost:3000/login

Production (HTTPS, sans ports) : voir [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md)

- Site : https://taxinabiso.newsystemcorps.com
- Admin : https://admin.taxinabiso.newsystemcorps.com
- Raccourcis : `/admin` et `/admin/login` redirigent vers le sous-domaine admin

## Architecture

```
Rider app (Expo)     Driver app (Expo)     Admin portal (Next.js)
                            |
                       Supabase
        (Postgres+PostGIS, Auth, Realtime, Storage, Edge Functions)
                            |
                Stripe Connect       Valhalla        Twilio / Expo Push
```

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full picture.

## Compliance scope

OpenRide stores the **records** an operator needs to demonstrate compliance: driver authorities, vehicle inspections, CTP/insurance documents with expiry tracking, fatigue sessions, incident reports, audit trails, manual override logs.

**The operator remains the regulated entity.** Hosting OpenRide does not transfer or absolve any statutory obligation. See [`docs/COMPLIANCE.md`](docs/COMPLIANCE.md) for the AU-generic baseline and how to add state-specific rule packs.
